## ðŸš¨ Be aware

This template integrates Node.js API to the renderer process by default. If you want to follow **Electron Security Concerns** you might want to disable this feature. You will have to expose needed API by yourself.  

To get started, remove the option as shown below. This will [modify the Vite configuration and disable this feature](https://github.com/electron-vite/vite-plugin-electron-renderer#config-presets-opinionated).

```diff
# vite.config.ts

export default {
  plugins: [
    ...
-   // Use Node.js API in the Renderer-process
-   renderer({
-     nodeIntegration: true,
-   }),
    ...
  ],
}
```
